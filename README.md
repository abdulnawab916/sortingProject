# Employee Sorting Project 

This program essentially sorts employees and their data.
Uses the Bubble Sort Algorithm which has a O(n^2) complexity.

## Getting Started

Depending on what OS you are using, you will read the files in
differently, here is a helpful YouTube video if you are using Windows:

## Testing

When downloading the files, you can check if it sorts correctly,
depending on the condition of the code.


### Adding your own tests!

You can create your own files in the terminal/command line if you
are using Unix/Linux. Open your terminal, and type the following
command and create a file like 'empdata.txt" in the repository. 
Have a similar style to it.

When opening your terminal type the following command and use the
search bar to find it.
```
touch <filename.txt> (without brackets)
```
